## About ThankYou

ThankYou is simple notification application for basically everyone. It uses a lot of community packages, so there is no need to keep it private. Don't expect a lot of updates and fixes, but feel free to ask anything about it. 

After seting up whole system, I will focus on design of notifications (primarly on emails) and adding some funny Slack notifications.
