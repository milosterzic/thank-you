## About ThankYou

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/8af94a0367ec41f5a751ff1bbc98e7a2)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/terzic.milos.tm/thank-you?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=milosterzic/thank-you&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

ThankYou is simple notification application for basically everyone. It uses a lot of community packages, so there is no need to keep it private. Don't expect a lot of updates and fixes, but feel free to ask anything about it. 

After seting up whole system, I will focus on design of notifications (primarly on emails) and adding some funny Slack notifications.
